# X Jailbreak Plugin Documentation
## Official documentation of X Jailbreak plugin making
To make a plugin in X Jailbreak, you must know the format. The format is in the following, surrounded by quotations:  
"  
\# Plugin Name  
\## Plugin description and/or author(s)  
/command [syntax] - Command description, syntax function  
/command - Command description  
"  
Know you can add as many commands as you want, and you only need one. You can also add as much syntax as you want, but it is advised to have a max of 10 commands and 5 syntax options per command, but recommended is 5 commands tops and 2 syntax options per command tops.  
To add plugins, which you would want to do to test your plugins and let users add them, use "/plugin add" and then hit Enter. When prompted, put the plugin text to add it into the prompt, and hit Enter or the Send button. The X Jailbreak plugin system will add this plugin and let you use it. Simple as that! Know that ChatGPT, or MS Copilot (upcoming support) will sometimes echo it, and your plugin name will be shown in Header 1, and your plugin description and/or author name(s) will be shown in Header 2. This is due to using Markdown, which this documentation is written in. As a little treat for reading this far, here's a little plugin that lets you get plugin development support in X Jailbreak:
